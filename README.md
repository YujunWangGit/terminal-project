my first time using github, gitbash, vscode, git



notes: 

you can find where a folder or file is by using command "find -name <item you want to find>"

mv can be used to rename and also move things 

you can move folders by staying in the same folder and then use find to find where it is, you copy that and then use that as the first parameter, and then use the directory of where you want to move it as the second parameter. the "./" is needed and is important!
